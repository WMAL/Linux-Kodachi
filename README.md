# Linux Kodachi - Kodachi 9

**Linux Kodachi** is a **privacy-focused Linux distribution built on Debian**. It provides a hardened, privacy-preserving desktop designed to balance security with usability, delivering a pre-wired anonymity stack (failover VPN, Tor routing, DNSCrypt, and anti-forensic tooling) that most operating systems leave you to assemble yourself. **Kodachi 9** features a modular architecture that breaks traditional barriers, enabling deployment across any Debian-based Linux distribution through **standalone binaries**, a **command-line terminal version**, or the upcoming **complete desktop experience**. Each deployment option provides the same robust security and privacy protection that Kodachi is known for.

### Deployment Options - Built on the Same Foundation

All Kodachi 9 editions are built on the same core security foundation:

- **Standalone Binaries**: Individual privacy and security tools that can be installed on any Debian-based system. Perfect for adding Kodachi security features to your existing Linux installation.
- **Terminal Server Version**: Lightweight ISO with all binaries pre-configured and optimized terminal interface. Ideal for dedicated privacy systems, servers, and headless deployments.
- **Desktop Edition** (Coming Feb 2026): Complete experience with GUI dashboard built on the Terminal Server Version foundation. Provides the full Kodachi experience with intuitive graphical controls.

**All three options share the same core binaries and security features** - choose based on your deployment needs and preferences.

# Kodachi 9 Development Roadmap

This roadmap provides an overview of the current status of key components in the Kodachi project. All code and infrastructure have been written from scratch; however, I have integrated the working code from the old version to avoid reinventing the wheel and accelerate development.

### **Kodachi 9: A New Era is Coming!**

**Kodachi 9** is currently under development and will be based on **<span style="color:blue;">Debian</span>**. The project is approximately **<span style="color:green;">90% complete</span>** (as of February 2026). Every script has been rewritten from scratch to enhance performance and functionality. This effort has taken time, but the result will significantly improve the Kodachi experience.

Stay tuned for more updates! Check out the [R&D progress](https://github.com/WMAL/Linux-Kodachi/tree/main/Kodachi-9/v9-behind-scenes-progress) for Kodachi 9.
