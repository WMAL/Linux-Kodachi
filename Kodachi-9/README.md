# Kodachi 9 Development Roadmap

This roadmap provides an overview of the current status of key components in the Kodachi project. All code and infrastructure have been written from scratch; however, I have integrated the working code from the old version to avoid reinventing the wheel and accelerate development.

| Component                                                                          | Status            | Completion                                                                          |

## Release Plan Going Forward ![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Release%20Plan-blue?style=for-the-badge)

### Phase 1: Kodachi Client Binary Backend ![RELEASED](https://img.shields.io/badge/-RELEASED-brightgreen?style=flat-square)

**Status:** ![Complete](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-brightgreen?style=flat-square)
**Documentation:** [Installation Guide](https://www.kodachi.cloud/wiki/bina/installation.html)
**Description:** Standalone Kodachi binaries that work on any Linux distribution
**Benefits:**

- Fastest deployment to users
- Cross-distro compatibility testing
- Early bug detection without needing ISO builds
- Community feedback on core functionality

### Phase 2: Kodachi Terminal Version ![RELEASED](https://img.shields.io/badge/-RELEASED-brightgreen?style=flat-square)

**Status:** ![Complete](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-brightgreen?style=flat-square)
**Documentation:** [Terminal Version Guide](https://www.kodachi.cloud/wiki/bina/terminal-version.html)
**Description:** Terminal-based edition with lightweight CLI interface and full backend integration
**Technical Foundation:** Built on all standalone binaries from Phase 1 with optimized system integration

**Benefits:**

- All Phase 1 binaries pre-installed and configured
- Smaller attack surface for security hardening
- Network and security module stabilization
- Core system testing without GUI overhead
- Foundation for desktop edition
- Perfect for servers and headless systems
- Same privacy tools as standalone binaries, but with seamless integration

### Phase 3: Kodachi Desktop Edition (Coming Soon)

**Target:** February 2026
**Description:** Full desktop experience with polished GUI and dashboard integration
**Benefits:**

- Incorporates all feedback from Phases 1 & 2
- Refined UX based on real-world usage
- Complete Gambas GUI dashboard
- Most stable and feature-complete release

### Why This Order?

**• Binaries First** ![Complete](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Complete-brightgreen?style=flat-square) = Fastest way to get real-world coverage on any distro. We catch environment bugs early without rebuilding ISOs.

**• Terminal Next** ![Complete](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Complete-brightgreen?style=flat-square) = Stabilize network and security modules on a smaller, lighter attack surface, and harden the core that the Desktop will use.

**• Desktop Last** ![In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/-In%20Progress-orange?style=flat-square) = Integrate user feedback, polish UX, and ship the full experience. **Target: Feb 2026**

### Technical Progression

Each phase builds upon the previous, ensuring maximum stability and security:

**Phase 1 (Standalone Binaries)** = Individual tools → Modular testing and development
**Phase 2 (Terminal Version)** = Binaries + System Integration → Hardened foundation
**Phase 3 (Desktop Edition)** = Terminal + GUI Dashboard → Complete user experience

This progression ensures that each layer is thoroughly tested and hardened before the next is built on top of it.

### What This Means for Users:

• **Available Now**: Binaries and Terminal Version are ready for immediate use
• **Better Stability**: Desktop edition benefits from real-world testing of Phases 1 & 2
• **Flexible Deployment**: Choose the edition that fits your needs (binaries, terminal, or wait for desktop)
• **Community-Driven**: Your feedback from current releases shapes the desktop edition

### Current Status:

• ![Available](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Available-brightgreen?style=flat-square) **Standalone Binaries**: [Install individual tools on any Linux distribution](https://www.kodachi.cloud/wiki/bina/installation.html) - Perfect for adding Kodachi privacy tools to your existing system

• ![Available](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Available-brightgreen?style=flat-square) **Terminal Version**: [Complete system with all binaries pre-integrated](https://www.kodachi.cloud/wiki/bina/terminal-version.html) - Perfect for dedicated privacy systems, servers, and headless deployments

• ![Coming Soon](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Coming%20Soon-yellow?style=flat-square) **Desktop Edition**: Coming February 2026 with complete GUI dashboard built on Terminal Version foundation

• **All editions share the same core binaries and security features** - Choose based on your deployment needs

---

Each of the above components is now integrated or in final testing stages. Kodachi 9 will support both GUI-based control and CLI command-driven interaction.

## Development Approach

- **From Scratch with Legacy Integration:**
  Every component has been re-engineered from the ground up to ensure modern, robust architecture. That said, the working code from the previous version was utilized where applicable to maintain proven functionality and save valuable development time.
