# Kodachi 9 Development Roadmap

This roadmap provides an overview of the current status of key components in the Kodachi project. All code and infrastructure have been written from scratch; however, I have integrated the working code from the old version to avoid reinventing the wheel and accelerate development.

## Release Plan Going Forward üöÄ

### Phase 1: Kodachi Binaries (Universal Linux)

**Target:** After binary testing completion (Task #4)
**Description:** Release standalone Kodachi binaries that work on any Linux distribution
**Benefits:**

- Fastest deployment to users
- Cross-distro compatibility testing
- Early bug detection without needing ISO builds
- Community feedback on core functionality

### Phase 2: Kodachi Debian Server

**Target:** 2 weeks after Phase 1
**Description:** Terminal-based server edition with optional lightweight TUI
**Benefits:**

- Smaller attack surface for security hardening
- Network and security module stabilization
- Core system testing without GUI overhead
- Foundation for desktop edition

### Phase 3: Kodachi Debian Desktop (Xfce)

**Target:** 4 weeks after Phase 2
**Description:** Full desktop experience with polished Xfce interface
**Benefits:**

- Incorporates all feedback from Phases 1 & 2
- Refined UX based on real-world usage
- Most stable and feature-complete release

### Why This Order?

**‚Ä¢ Binaries First** = Fastest way to get real-world coverage on any distro. We catch environment bugs early without rebuilding ISOs.

**‚Ä¢ Server Next** = Stabilize network and security modules on a smaller, lighter attack surface, and harden the core that the Desktop will use.

**‚Ä¢ Desktop Last** = Integrate user feedback, polish UX, and ship the full experience.

### What This Means for Users:

‚Ä¢ **Earlier Access**: Get features sooner with smaller downloads
‚Ä¢ **Better Stability**: Desktop benefits from two phases of testing
‚Ä¢ **Flexible Deployment**: Choose the edition that fits your needs
‚Ä¢ **Community-Driven**: Your feedback shapes each subsequent release

### Notes:

‚Ä¢ The Server edition is not the final look - it's the backbone for Desktop
‚Ä¢ All editions share the same core security and privacy features
‚Ä¢ Binaries can be integrated into existing Linux installations

Each of the above components is now integrated or in final testing stages. Kodachi 9 will support both GUI-based control and CLI command-driven interaction.

## Development Approach

- **From Scratch with Legacy Integration:**
  Every component has been re-engineered from the ground up to ensure modern, robust architecture. That said, the working code from the previous version was utilized where applicable to maintain proven functionality and save valuable development time.
