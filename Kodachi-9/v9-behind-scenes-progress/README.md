# ![Kodachi](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kodachi%20v9-Behind%20the%20Scenes%20Progress-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=shield) Kodachi v9 – Behind the Scenes Progress

Welcome to the **Behind-the-Scenes** folder for the development of **Kodachi v9**. This space documents the ongoing engineering efforts, security architecture decisions, implementation strategies, and technical milestones shaping the next generation of the Kodachi Security OS.

Here you'll find a collection of:
- ![Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Security%20Design%20Documents-red?style=flat-square&logo=lock) **Security design documents**
- ![Insights](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Architecture%20Insights-yellow?style=flat-square&logo=lightbulb) **Architecture insights**
- ![Videos](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Development%20Videos-red?style=flat-square&logo=video) **Development videos and feature walkthroughs**
- ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Experimental%20Notes-purple?style=flat-square&logo=flask) **Experimental notes and early concepts**
- ![Technical](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Technical%20Breakdowns-gray?style=flat-square&logo=toolbox) **Technical breakdowns of hardened components**

## ![Purpose](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Purpose-green?style=flat-square&logo=pushpin) Purpose

The goal of this folder is to provide **transparency and technical depth** into the decisions and challenges involved in building Kodachi v9. It's a **progress log** from the perspective of the lead developer, designed to share not only solutions, but the *thinking behind them*.

We believe security tools should be as open in design as they are strong in defense — this folder is part of that commitment.
