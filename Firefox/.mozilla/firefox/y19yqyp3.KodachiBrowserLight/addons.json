Easy on CPU and memory.","fullDescription":"An efficient blocker: easy on memory and CPU footprint, and yet can load and enforce thousands more filters than other popular blockers out there.\n\nIllustrated overview of its efficiency: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-vs.-ABP:-efficiency-compared\n\nUsage: The big power button in the popup is to permanently disable/enable uBlock for the current web site. It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","weeklyDownloads":246298,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Raymond Hill","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11423598/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157572.png?modified=1543520531","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157572.png?modified=1543520531","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Default mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157576.png?modified=1543520531","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157576.png?modified=1543520531","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"The dashboard: stock filter lists"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157592.png?modified=1543520532","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157592.png?modified=1543520532","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Dynamic filtering allows default-deny mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/159/159634.png?modified=1543520533","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/159/159634.png?modified=1543520533","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"The dashboard: settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158734.png?modified=1543520534","width":700,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158734.png?modified=1543520534","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Unified logger"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6971,"reviewCount":3684,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/reviews/","updateDate":1566574726000},{"id":"{73a6fe31-595d-460b-a920-fcc0f8843232}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/722-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/722-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/722-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"NoScript Security Suite","version":"11.0.3","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3383315/noscript_security_suite-11.0.3-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://noscript.net","supportURL":"https://noscript.net/forum","description":"The best security you can get in a web browser!\nAllow active content to run only from sites you trust, and protect yourself against XSS other web security exploits.\nDisabled and can't reinstall?

The \"Download history\" permission is required only because Firefox does not allow add-ons to specify just \"download files\" without \"download history\". It's all or nothing. Internally, nothing is done with your download history. This is open source software and you can view the code yourself by unzipping the downloaded then using a text viewer.\n\n\"Clear recent browsing history, cookies, and related data\": this is used by the big eraser button since version 6.3. You can delete cookies, cache, etc with one-click. Next version will allow you to clear the data automatically when switching proxies, just like the old FoxyProxy (pre-Firefox Quantum / Firefox 57). Download history is NOT cleared, so we do not need that permission. It will be removed shortly. It was added by mistake.\n\nANDROID\nSince Firefox on Android does not support the proxyAPI, FoxyProxy does not work. This is a limitation of Firefox on Android, not FoxyProxy.

Your private bookmarks are encrypted with your chosen password. This is not an online service, and you are in control of what data leaves your machine (if at all).\n\nWhen you unlock your private bookmarks, a new 'Private Bookmarks' folder appears under 'Other Bookmarks'. You can add/remove items to it and when ready, lock it. Whenever an item is added/removed, the contents of the folder are encrypted and stored on your machine. When locked, the folder itself is removed from your browser's bookmarks collection.\n\nBy default, Private Bookmarks can only be accessed when in private browsing (to help avoid accidents), however that can be changed via the options page.\n\nBe aware!\nThis extension is still in early development, so bugs are to be expected, and you should backup your bookmarks periodically to be safe. Also, since I am bound by Firefox regarding what it allows extensions to do, I cannot guarantee complete privacy. Mobile versions of Firefox are not supported because they do not yet allow extensions access to your bookmarks the way desktop versions do.\n\nA note for Firefox Sync users\nRefrain from switching between devices while your private bookmarks are unlocked. Although personally I wasn't able to reproduce, there have been some reports of Sync getting confused and it may result in a copy of the folder remaining visible on other devices. I recommend unlocking, using, and locking all on the same device. If you encounter these issues, I also advise to trigger a sync from the Firefox menu after every lock so that you're sure the deletion of the folder goes through to your other devices. Sorry about the inconvenience.\n\nCustom folder location and name\nYou can move/rename the folder, and the next time you unlock it will appear in that location and with that name.\n\nAuto-locking\nThere are a few cases where the extension auto locks your private bookmarks:\n\n    If you have selected the \"disable outside of private browsing\" option (it is on by default) Private Bookmarks auto-locks when the last private window is closed.\n    If you have selected the \"auto-lock when idle\" option Private Bookmarks auto-locks once the system's been idle for a user-specified amount of time.\n    If you manually delete the Private Bookmarks folder.\n    If you close the browser while your private bookmarks are unlocked, the next time you open it the leftover Private Bookmarks folder is deleted immediately.\n\n\nBackup\nYou can export both encrypted/plain versions of your private bookmark data from within the options page. However, to import an encrypted backup file you must remember the password you used when that backup was made.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\nThe following shortcuts are available:\n\n    Alt+Shift+8 opens the menu in a new tab. If you have selected the \"disable outside of private browsing\" option (it is on by default) the tab will open in a private window.\n    Ctrl+Shift+8 adds the current page to your private bookmarks (requires unlocked bookmarks).\n    Ctrl+Shift+F8 adds all tabs in the current window to your private bookmarks (requires unlocked bookmarks).\n    Ctrl+Shift+L locks the folder (requires unlocked bookmarks).\n\n\nSomething's not working?

Use GitHub instead.\n\nPlease note that even if it doesn't work for you, it works for other people so it's probably a problem with your Firefox settings and not with the extension. See troubleshooting steps.\n\nPermission Request Explanations\n- Access your data for all websites: CAD requests this to delete cookies for all sites\n- Clear recent browsing history, cookies and related data: Ability to delete Localstorage.\n- Display notifications to you: Self explanatory.\n- Read and modify privacy settings: Automatic detection of First Party Isolation support. Although the Privacy permission gives CAD \"read and modify\" permissions, NO MODIFICATIONS are done to your privacy settings, CAD only reads the setting of First Party Isolation. The privacy permission unfortunately cannot be given granular control, so this will stay for now.\n- Access browser tabs: CAD uses this permission to display the site hostname in the popup for easy whitelisting/greylisting, displaying the amount of cookies for that site, and which rules apply to that site.\n\nTake the permission wording with a grain of salt.\n\nMain Features\n- Auto Deletes Cookies from Closed Tabs\n- WhiteList/GreyList Support for Cookies\n- Easily Export/Import your Whitelist/Greylist\n- Clear All Cookies for a Domain\n- Supports Manual Mode Cleaning from the popup\n- Easily See the Number of Cookies for a site\n- Support for Container Tabs (Firefox 53+ Only)\n\nUsage\nThis extension does not clean cookies automatically until you enable \"Auto-clean\". This gives you the chance to add sites to the WhiteList.\n\n1. Add the sites you want to keep cookies in the WhiteList (permanently) or GreyList (until Browser restart)\n2. Toggle \"Auto-clean\" in the popup or \"Automatic cleaning\" in the settings\n3. Watch those unused cookies disappear :)\n\nYou must enable cookies in the browser as this extension will replace the internal cookie manager.\n\nYou can disable Cleanup Notifications via the Settings.\n\nPopup Menu Features\nClean: This is basically a quick way of activating the Cookie Cleanup on demand. This looks at all your cookies and deletes them if they are not in any Open Tabs or the WhiteList.\nClean, include open tabs: Same thing as Cookie Cleanup except that it only deletes cookies only if they are not in the WhiteList. Open tabs are not taken into consideration.\nClear All Cookies for This Domain: Easy way to delete all cookies for one particular domain that you are on.\n\nSome things to Note:\n- This extension can clear localstorage as of version 2.1.0 and Firefox 58+. Enable it in the settings.\n\n- Even though third party cookies are cleared with this extension, it is better to disable third party cookies from the settings\n\nDocumentation\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you have any other problem, file an issue on GitHub. Maybe we can work it out.\n\nBTC: 16km6pFV33S6kaeb8rCaDLZXUyo3uyVnsk","weeklyDownloads":12406,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Kenny Do","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12748480/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/189/189656.png?modified=1543520768","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189656.png?modified=1543520768","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/185/185648.png?modified=1543520768","width":413,"height":135,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185648.png?modified=1543520768","thumbnailWidth":413,"thumbnailHeight":135,"caption":"Notifications"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/189/189657.png?modified=1543520769","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189657.png?modified=1543520769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/189/189658.png?modified=1543520769","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189658.png?modified=1543520769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Expression Table"}],"contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.me/mrkennyd/5","averageRating":4.5773,"reviewCount":431,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/reviews/","updateDate":1556488510000},{"id":"@testpilot-containers","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/782/782160-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/782/782160-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/782/782160-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Firefox Multi-Account Containers","version":"6.1.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/1400557/firefox_multi_account_containers-6.1.0-fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers/#readme","supportURL":"https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers/issues","description":"Firefox Multi-Account Containers lets you keep parts of your online life separated into color-coded tabs that preserve your privacy. Cookies are separated by container, allowing you to use the web with multiple identities or accounts simultaneously.","fullDescription":"About This Extension\n\nThe Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension lets you carve out a separate box for each of your online lives – no more opening a different browser just to check your work email! Here is a quick video showing you how it works.\n\nUnder the hood, it separates website storage into tab-specific Containers. Cookies downloaded by one Container are not available to other Containers. With the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, you can...\n\n    Sign in to two different accounts on the same site (for example, you could sign in to work email and home email in two different Container tabs.\n    Keep different kinds of browsing far away from each other (for example, you might use one Container tab for managing your Checking Account and a different Container tab for searching for new songs by your favorite band)\n    Avoid leaving social-network footprints all over the web (for example, you could use a Container tab for signing in to a social network, and use a different tab for visiting online news sites, keeping your social identity separate from tracking scripts on news sites)\n\n\nAfter installing the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, click the Containers icon to edit your Containers. Change their colors, names, and icons. Long-click the new tab button to open a new Container tab.\n\nPrivacy in Firefox Multi-Account Containers\n\nThe Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension does not send any information to Mozilla.\n\nHow does this compare to the Facebook Container extension?\nFacebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. The Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container. This extension can be customized to suit your needs for multiple sites and multiple logins, but takes more time to set up than Facebook Container.\n\nYou can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.\n\nFacebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.\n\nCan I use both Multi-Account Containers and Facebook Container?\nYes, but you need to be a little careful. Don't use Multi-Account Container to assign facebook.com to a Container, and then try installing Facebook Container. If you a Multi-Account Containers user and want to use both addons, unassign facebook.com, messenger.com, and instagram.com first, then install Facebook Container.\n\nHaven't I seen this in Firefox before?\n\nFirefox Multi-Account Containers was first introduced as \"Containers\" available only in Firefox Nightly. It went on to be a Test Pilot Experiment, where we improved the user experience and added new features.

Think SwitchyOmega as a modern version of the \"Proxy Settings\" dialog, designed to be simpler, quicker and more powerful, specially optimized for your browser.\n\nNo more digging through the advanced section in system settings. No repeated filling and clearing the proxy config dialog of your operating system. Just tell SwitchyOmega about all your proxies, and enjoy switching with one click on the popup menu. You can also teach Auto Switch to use the right proxy for the right website automatically.\n\nNOTE: Please report issues by RIGHT-clicking the extension icon and select the \"Report Issue\" in the context menu so that I can locate and fix the issue more quickly.\n\nAlternative download link (Github): https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega/releases\n\nSwitchyOmega is absolutely free and open source. It does not insert ads into any website. It contains absolutely no malware. It just does proxy configuration, and aims to be perfect tool of that.\n\nDisclaimer: SwitchyOmega does not come with any proxy server, VPNs or anything like that. Thus, SwitchyOmega will not magically unblock websites or protect your privacy, unless you instruct it to use a proxy server which does. You should only use trusted proxy servers, because SwitchyOmega can not protect you from bad proxies that inject ads, track you or record your password. And if you don't have a proxy server, you probably won't need SwitchyOmega. Sounds reasonable, right?\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega/wiki/Privacy#english\n\nThe 2.x version features:\n* HTTP/HTTPS proxy authentication (username & password) is now supported.\n* More flexible proxy configurations: Fixed servers, multiple SwitchProfile and rule lists.\n* Reviewing and modifying proxy settings for resources that fail to load.\n* New types of condition for switching and improvements to the existing condition types.\n* Optimized performance for both PAC script generating and switching.\n* Improved user experience in options page and dropdown menu.\n* Many Bug fixes and improvements. More testing.\n\n== Translations ==\nYou can help improve the translation of SwitchyOmega or translate it into your language on Weblate:\nhttps://hosted.weblate.org/engage/switchyomega/?utm_source=widget\n\nCONFLICTS: SwitchyOmega will conflict with other extensions trying to control the proxy settings. Such conflicts are caused by the design of the browser and thus cannot be avoided. When SwitchyOmega has a higher priority, it can be configured to voluntarily give back the control by selecting the [System Proxy] item in the popup menu. Otherwise, you will see a red badge on the SwitchyOmega icon indicating insufficient priority. Re-installing SwitchyOmega should raise its priority, providing a possible workaround.","weeklyDownloads":6404,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Firefox user
