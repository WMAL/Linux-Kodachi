# Linux Kodachi Overview

The <abbr title="Linux is, in simplest terms, an operating system. It is the software on a computer that enables applications and the computer operator to access the devices on the computer to perform desired functions. The operating system (OS) relays instructions from an application to, for instance, the computer's processor.">Linux</abbr> Kodachi operating system, a derivative of Xubuntu 18.04.6, offers a highly secure, anti-forensic, and anonymous computing environment. It's designed with privacy in mind, incorporating all the features needed to maintain user confidentiality and security.

With a straightforward setup process, Kodachi is user-friendly and doesn't require any Linux expertise. Simply boot the system from a USB drive, and you'll be up and running with a fully-operational operating system. This includes an automatically established <abbr title="VPN is a network that is constructed by using public wires — usually the Internet — to connect to a private network, such as a company's internal network. There are a number of systems that enable you to create networks using the Internet as the medium for transporting data.">VPN</abbr> connection, a pre-configured <abbr title="Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security.">TOR</abbr> connection, and a running <abbr title="dnscrypt-proxy provides local service which can be used directly as your local resolver or as a DNS forwarder, encrypting and authenticating requests using the DNSCrypt protocol and passing them to an upstream server.">DNSCrypt</abbr> service, all optimized to maximize your online security and privacy.

One of the key features of Kodachi is its transient nature. The entire operating system operates from your computer's temporary RAM memory. As a result, once you power down the system, it leaves no trace—effectively erasing all your activities and ensuring that your privacy is maintained at all times.

Kodachi is a live operating system, meaning it can be launched on virtually any computer from a DVD, USB stick, or SD card. Its primary goal is to preserve your privacy and anonymity. The features of Kodachi are designed to enable you to:

- Browse the internet anonymously: All of your online connections are routed through a  VPN and then the Tor network, coupled with DNS encryption, to ensure maximum privacy.
- Leave no trace on the host computer: Kodachi does not leave any footprints on the computer you're using, unless explicitly instructed to do so.
- Utilize cutting-edge cryptographic and privacy tools: These tools allow you to encrypt your files, emails, and instant messages to further enhance your privacy.

Built on the robust foundations of Linux Xubuntu/Debian and customized with XFCE, Kodachi presents a stable, secure, and uniquely personalized operating system.

Linux Kodachi 9 is currently under development and will be based on Debian. The project is approximately 88% complete, with all scripts rewritten for improved performance. The release timeline is subject to change, but I am working diligently to bring this enhanced version to users as soon as possible. 🚀<br>For those interested in tracking the development progress and roadmap, visit: <a href="https://github.com/WMAL/Linux-Kodachi" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">GitHub - Linux Kodachi 9 Development</a>.

With an average of **7,000** downloads per month and peaks of up to **10,000**, as verified by <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxkodachi/files/kodachi-8.27-64-kernel-6.2.iso/stats/timeline?dates=2023-02-01%20to%202024-11-01&period=monthly" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">SourceForge</a> statistics, Kodachi has earned a trusted place in the cybersecurity landscape.

### Transformation & Impact (2020-2023)

Kodachi is more than software—it has been a transformative journey for both myself and its community. Users consistently share how it has changed their approach to digital privacy, shifting them from passive observers to proactive guardians of their security. For many, Kodachi has been the bridge that opened their eyes to the true potential of Linux.

### Commitment & Dedication (2023-Present)

Even as a one-person project, Kodachi continues to grow through relentless dedication and the inspiration drawn from its community. I prioritize security and stability above all else, addressing vulnerabilities swiftly and releasing timely patches—often multiple in succession—to ensure reliability. This hands-on, rapid response reflects my deep commitment to protecting users.

### The Future Mission (2025 & Beyond)

Kodachi represents the rare balance of advanced protection with true ease of use. Every release strengthens this foundation, ensuring users can rely on it to safeguard their digital lives. Looking ahead, my mission remains the same: to evolve Kodachi as a trusted, cutting-edge platform where privacy and security are not optional, but built-in for everyone.

## Security Models

#### Understanding Security Components

Each component in Kodachi serves a specific security or anonymity function:

**Torified System**: A setup where all device traffic is routed through the Tor network, enhancing privacy across applications. This ensures that every application on your device uses Tor, making it highly secure and private.

**Kodachi Loaded Browser**: This browser is configured for maximum security, with additional privacy plugins and a default setup that routes all traffic through the Tor network. While this setup enhances anonymity and security, it may result in slower browsing speeds and can be blocked by some websites. The Loaded Browser is ideal for critical activities requiring heightened privacy.

**Kodachi Lite Browser**: The Lite Browser is optimized for speed, with fewer plugins and no default Tor configuration. It is suitable for general tasks, such as checking email and browsing websites that don't require intense privacy measures. This browser offers faster performance, and its non-Tor connection is less likely to be restricted by websites.

**Kodachi ghacks Browser**: Built on the foundation of the Loaded Browser, the ghacks Browser includes additional security enhancements based on the well-known ghacks project. It provides an even higher level of security, making it ideal for users who need the utmost protection. However, due to its intensive security settings, some websites may not function as expected. This browser is best suited for highly sensitive activities where maximum security is essential.

- **VPN**: Encrypts all internet traffic to provide a unified point of anonymization.
- **Tor or Tor Browser**: Encrypts only browser traffic through the Tor network, routing it via multiple nodes for anonymity.
- **Torified System**: Configures all device traffic to pass through Tor, boosting privacy across applications.
- **Dnscrypt**: Encrypts DNS queries, ensuring the privacy of browsing activity through DNS over TLS.
- **Tor DNS**: Randomly encrypts DNS queries within the Tor network, further securing your DNS activity.

#### Recommended Configurations for Anonymity and Security

#### For Optimal Anonymity:

1. **Maximum Anonymity (but slower performance)**<br />ISP ➔ Router VPN ➔ Kodachi VPN (VM NAT) ➔ Torified System ➔ Tor DNS ➔ Kodachi loaded browser.
